			<h2> Year and State Laws Influence Trends in Abortion Data </h2>
			<h4> A look into how the overturning of Roe v Wade impacts abortion numbers <br><br>by Katie Nedder 
			</h4>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>In June 2022, the US Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade, a Supreme Court decision from 1973 that legalized abortion for the first two months of a pregnancy. 

				<br>
				<br>

			According to  <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023" target="_blank">the Guttmacher Institute</a>, a research and policy organization that focuses on reproductive rights in the United States, 1,026,690 abortions were estimated to have occurred in 2023 in the formal healthcare system. This number of estimated abortions is a 10% increase since 2020. 

			<br>
			<br>

			The Guttmacher Institute explains that people continue to receive abortions despite restricted access to abortions in some states. Since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, 14 states banned abortion access with some exceptions.  

<br>
<br>
			The dataset “Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States: National and State Trends by Age,” gathered by the Guttmacher Institute, analyzes national and state statistics on abortion, miscarriage, pregnancy, birth, and population data in the United States, spanning from 1973, the year of Roe v Wade, to 2017. The data is a part of a Guttmacher Institute project called “Adding It Up,” which researches the need for, the impact of, and the costs of sexual and reproductive health services. 

			<br>
			<br>

			Donna Edmonds, an Obstetrics nurse in Massachusetts for over 20 years, explains the medical definition of abortions in terms of the difference between medical abortions and spontaneous abortions. 

			<br>
			<br>

			“People will call them abortions or terminations, it’s different terminology in medical terms. Every time a pregnancy ends, it’s technically called an abortion whether it’s a spontaneous abortion, meaning your body just terminated the baby on its own, or a medical abortion where you medically caused it to happen,” Edmonds says.

			<h3>Abortion Data by Year</h3>
			<p>
The Guttmacher Institute’s data suggests that the year 1988 had a number of 780,500 abortions, the largest number of abortions performed among people ages 15 to 19.
<br>
			<br>


“As you did probably back in the 80s or 90s, where people didn’t have good access to birth control, so I think that people are a little better about preventing it, to begin with,” explains Edmonds on why the number of abortions in the United States was greater in the late 80s. 
<br>
			<br>


Donna Edmonds states that a decreased number of abortions is an indicator of better education and better access to birth control. This includes access to IUDs, which was not always an option. 
<br>
			<br>


“It’s access. It’s having access to birth control,” says Edmonds in response to changes in trends in the number of abortions that have occurred since 1973.

			<h3>Abortion Access by State</h3>
			<p>However, the state with the most abortions performed among people ages 20 to 24 is California, with 1,102,760 abortions. The second most is New York, with 733,520 abortions. The third highest is Florida, with 442,920 abortions.
				<br>
			<br>

According to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023" target="_blank">the Guttmacher Institute</a>, between 2020 and 2023, states without a total ban on abortions saw a 25% increase in abortions. States such as California and New York provide greater access to abortion than other states.
<br>
			<br>

Since the overturning of Roe v Wade, California has expanded abortion access, states <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/california/" target="_blank">the Center for Reproductive Rights</a>. California has state laws that protect personal reproductive decision rights, and the state’s Prop 1 adds abortion and contraception rights to their constitution, which was approved in November 2022. There are similar laws for reproductive rights in New York state. However, <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/florida/#:~:text=Now%20that%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20overturned%20Roe%2C%20Florida%20is,to%20abortion%20prior%20to%20viability." target="_blank">Florida</a> has more hostile laws toward abortions and reproductive rights. Since 2022, Florida has enforced a six-week abortion ban.

<br>
			<br>
<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/sfaa-fl.pdf" target="_blank"> The Guttmacher Institute</a> explains that 8.2% of all abortions performed in the United States are from Florida. Between 2014 and 2017, there was a 10% decrease in the Florida abortion rate. 
<br>
			<br>
Out of all 77,567,320 abortions performed in the United States between 1973 and 2017, as recorded by the Guttmacher Institute, 0.24% of them have been performed in Alabama. The total sum of all abortions between 1973 and 2017 that have occurred in Alabama is 189,140.
<br>
			<br>
According to <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/alabama/" target="_blank"> the Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, since the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022, Alabama is enforcing a total abortion ban. This ban prohibits abortion during all stages of pregnancy.  
<br>
			<br>
“The proportion of women at risk of unintended pregnancy who report use of highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods ranges from 6% in Alabama to 27% in Maine,” states Ayana Douglas-Hall, Kathryn Kost, and Megan L. Kavanaugh in their 2017 data report from the Guttmacher Institute. 
<br>
			<br>
Their <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/state-level-estimates-contraceptive-use-us-2017" target="_blank"> data </a>  focuses on the 2017 state-level US contraceptive use estimates. The data is gathered from surveys by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

			<h3>Limitations of Collecting Abortion Data</h3>
			<p>

			However, a limitation of this data is that these numbers are estimates. These abortion and contraceptive use datasets are collected from the formal US health system or are self-reported, which means that they have the potential to be skewed, especially in states with stricter reproductive rights. 
			<br>
			<br>

“I do think some of these numbers are skewed because I do think some people will lie and not say they were ever pregnant. When you call something a termination, too, it’s hard because sometimes, depending on where it is in your pregnancy, they can call it a spontaneous abortion vs a chemically induced abortion. You know, so your numbers will be a little bit skewed with that,” says Edmonds. 
<br>
			<br>

The estimates from the Guttmacher Institute are an undercount because the data only includes abortions obtained from the formal US health care system.
